# Matplotlib and Seaborn Practice Code

## Description
This repository contains my practice code for learning and mastering Matplotlib and Seaborn, two powerful libraries in Python for data visualization. The code in this repository covers various aspects of these libraries, from basic plots to more advanced data visualization techniques.

## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

- `matplotlib_basics/`: This directory contains scripts demonstrating the basic plotting capabilities of Matplotlib.
- `seaborn_basics/`: This directory contains scripts showcasing the basic data visualization capabilities of Seaborn.
- `advanced_visualizations/`: This directory contains scripts where I apply more advanced data visualization techniques using both Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
